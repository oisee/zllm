---

## 2. Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Core Functionality

This report demonstrates the following sequence:

1. **Parameter Input**:  
   - Accepts two free-text parameters (`p_prmpt1`, `p_prmpt2`) representing user prompts for the LLM.

2. **LLM Factory and Instance Creation**:  
   - Instantiates a factory object (`zcl_llm=>new`) to obtain an LLM instance configured via a default environment.

3. **Step Construction**:  
   - Creates two LLM "steps" (`zcl_llm_00_step_lazy=>new_from_string`), each representing a prompt to be processed by the LLM.

4. **Flow Construction**:  
   - Chains the two steps into a "flow" (`zcl_llm_00_flow_lazy=>new`), enabling sequential execution.

5. **Execution and Result Handling**:  
   - Executes the flow, collects the result, and converts it to a string.

6. **Markdown Rendering**:  
   - Converts the result string to HTML using a Markdown renderer (`zcl_llm_00_markdown=>new`).

7. **Output**:  
   - Displays the HTML result in the SAP GUI using `cl_demo_output=>display_html`.

**User Interaction**:  
- The report is triggered via the selection screen (standard SAP report mechanism). When the user executes (ONLI), the chained LLM flow is run.

- **Type**: Report (Executable Program)
- **Technical Category**: Demo/Utility â€“ Token Prediction for LLMs
- **System Role**: User-facing utility for demonstrating and testing the token prediction capabilities of the ZCL_LLM_00_PREDICTOKEN class, supporting both GPT and Mistral model types.

---

## 2. Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Core Functionality

This report provides an interactive demonstration of the token prediction feature for Large Language Models (LLMs) within the SAP system. It allows a user to:

- Select between two model types (GPT or Mistral) via radio buttons.
- Enter a free-form query (multi-line text) using the SAP standard text editor dialog.
- Predict the number of tokens that the selected LLM model would consume for the entered query.
- Display the predicted token count and echo the entered query using the SAP demo output class.

**Key Steps:**
1. **User Input**: The user selects a model type and enters a query.
2. **Token Prediction**: The report instantiates the appropriate token predictor and calculates the token count for the input.
3. **Output**: Results are displayed interactively.

### 2.2 Technical Architecture

- **Interfaces**:
  - **User Interface**: Classic SAP selection screen with radio buttons and a pop-up text editor (via `TERM_CONTROL_EDIT`).
  - **Output**: Uses `CL_DEMO_OUTPUT` for displaying results.

- **Dependencies**:
  - **ZCL_LLM_00_PREDICTOKEN**: Core class for token prediction logic.
  - **TERM_CONTROL_EDIT**: SAP standard function module for text input.
  - **CL_DEMO_OUTPUT**: SAP demo class for output display.

- **Data Flow**:
  1. User selects model and enters text.
  2. Text is passed to the token predictor.
  3. Token count is calculated and displayed.

### 2.3 Implementation Details

- **Selection Screen**: Two radio buttons (`P_R1` for GPT, `P_R2` for Mistral).
- **Text Input**: Uses `TERM_CONTROL_EDIT` to collect multi-line input into an internal table of type `STRING`.
- **Token Prediction**:
  - The model type is determined by the selected radio button.
  - The predictor object is created via `ZCL_LLM_00_PREDICTOKEN=>NEW_FOR_MODEL_TYPE`.
  - The method `PREDICT_FOR_ITAB` is called with the input text table.
- **Output**: The number of tokens is displayed, followed by the input text.

- **Error Handling**:
  - If the user cancels the text input, the form exits gracefully.
  - No explicit error handling for prediction failures; assumes the predictor class handles its own exceptions.

- **Performance**: Not performance-critical; designed for interactive demo use.

- **Custom Classes**: Heavy reliance on custom classes (e.g., `zcl_llm_00_llm_lazy`, `zcl_llm_00_step_lazy`, `zcl_llm_00_flow_lazy`, `zcl_llm_00_formula`, `zcl_llm_spl`, `zcl_llm_str_to_ted`, `zcl_llm_00_cache`, `zcl_xtt_file_smw0`, `zcl_markdown`, `zcl_blog`, `zcl_eui_alv`, `zcl_eui_screen`).
- **SAP Standard**: Uses standard SAP controls (`cl_gui_custom_container`, `cl_gui_html_viewer`, `cl_gui_textedit`, `cl_gui_alv_grid`), function modules (`SO_STRING_TO_TAB`), and type pools (`vrm`, `icon`, `cntb`).
- **Database Tables**: Reads from and writes to custom tables like `zllm_00_cache`.

#### Data Flow

- **Input**: User provides parameters and text via selection screens and text editors.
- **Processing**: Data flows through a series of steps, each potentially transforming the input using LLMs and custom logic.
- **Output**: Results are rendered as HTML/Markdown in SAP GUI containers, with options for preview, save, and export.

### 2.3 Implementation Details

- **OO-ABAP Design**: Encapsulates logic in local classes (`lcl_`, `lcl_htm_event_handler`), following factory and event-driven patterns.
- **Dynamic UI Construction**: Builds split screens and assigns text editors and HTML viewers at runtime.
- **Stepwise Execution**: Each step (`exec_step1` to `exec_step4`) processes input, updates outputs, and synchronizes UI elements.
- **Session Management**: Serializes session data as JSON for caching and transport.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Converts LLM output to Markdown and displays it as HTML in the SAP GUI.
- **Debugging Support**: Multiple debug flags (p_debug1â€“p_debug5) enable granular tracing of different processing layers.
- **Event Handling**: Implements handlers for ALV double-clicks, toolbar actions, and HTML events.
- **Error Handling**: Uses TRY/CATCH blocks and a centralized logging class (`zcl_blog`) for exception management.
