# ABAP Component Documentation: ZCL_LLM_00_CACHE

## 1. Component Overview

- **Type**: ABAP Class (`ZCL_LLM_00_CACHE`)
- **Namespace and Location**: Custom namespace (`Z*`), package `$ZLLM_00`
- **Technical Category**: Database cache utility (temporary, analytical)
- **System Role**: Provides a simple, persistent key-value cache for storing and retrieving intermediate or computed results, supporting performance optimization and temporary storage for graph-based LLM (Large Language Model) analysis modules.

## 2. Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Core Functionality

`ZCL_LLM_00_CACHE` implements a simple database-backed cache mechanism. It allows ABAP programs to store, retrieve, and manage key-value pairs in the database table `ZLLM_00_CACHE`. The cache is partitioned by a "seed" (context identifier), and supports optional encoding/decoding of values via a codec interface. The class provides methods to:

- **Create a cache instance** for a given seed/context and codec.
- **Store (`put`)** and **retrieve (`get`)** values by key.
- **Invalidate** (delete) individual cache entries.
- **Clear** the entire cache or all entries for a specific seed.
- **Trim** old cache entries based on date.
- **Commit** changes to the database.

### 2.2 Technical Architecture

#### Interfaces

- **`ZIF_LLM_00_CACHE`**: The class implements this interface, which defines the cache operations (`get`, `put`, `invalidate`, `clear`, `clear_for_seed`, `trim`).
- **`ZIF_LLM_00_CODEC`**: Optional codec interface for encoding/decoding values before storage/retrieval.

#### Dependencies

- **Database Table**: `ZLLM_00_CACHE` (see [Related Components](#related-components))
- **Codec Classes**: Implementations of `ZIF_LLM_00_CODEC` (e.g., `ZCL_LLM_00_CODEC`, `ZCL_LLM_00_CODEC_MOCK`)
- **Utility Class**: `ZCL_LLM` (for string hashing and xstring conversions)

#### Data Flow

- **Put**: Key and value are hashed/converted, optionally encoded, and stored in `ZLLM_00_CACHE`.
- **Get**: Key is hashed, value is retrieved, optionally decoded, and returned as a string.
- **Invalidate/Clear/Trim**: Remove entries from the cache table based on key, seed, or date.

#### Error Handling and Logging

- No explicit error handling or logging is implemented; standard ABAP database operations are used.
- If a cache entry is not found (`get`), the method returns immediately (empty result).

#### Performance Considerations

- Uses hashed keys for efficient lookup.
- Updates access counters and timestamps on each `get`.
- Provides a `trim` method to remove old entries and manage table size.

#### Security Implications

- No explicit authorization checks; access control must be managed at the application or table level.
- Data stored in the cache may include sensitive information; ensure proper table protection and data lifecycle management.

### 2.3 Implementation Details

#### Key Methods

- **`NEW`**: Factory method to create a cache instance for a given seed and codec.
- **`constructor`**: Initializes instance variables for seed and codec.
- **`zif_llm_00_cache~get`**: Retrieves a value by key, decodes if necessary, updates access metadata.
- **`zif_llm_00_cache~put`**: Stores a value by key, encodes if necessary, sets creation date and timestamp.
- **`zif_llm_00_cache~invalidate`**: Deletes a specific cache entry.
- **`zif_llm_00_cache~clear`**: Deletes all cache entries.
- **`zif_llm_00_cache~clear_for_seed`**: Deletes all entries for a specific seed.
- **`zif_llm_00_cache~trim`**: Deletes entries older than 14 days.
- **`commit`**: Commits the current LUW (Logical Unit of Work).

#### Database Interactions

- All cache operations are performed directly on the `ZLLM_00_CACHE` table.
- Uses standard ABAP Open SQL for `SELECT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, and `MODIFY`.

#### Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: `NEW` method for controlled instantiation.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Optional codec for encoding/decoding values.
- **Encapsulation**: Private constructor, public interface.

#### Example Usage

```abap
DATA(lo_cache) = zcl_llm_00_cache=>new( iv_seed = 123 ).
lo_cache->put( k = 'mykey' v = 'myvalue' ).
DATA(lv_value) = lo_cache->get( k = 'mykey' ).
```

## 3. Business Context

### 3.1 Business Purpose

The cache supports high-performance, temporary storage of intermediate results for analytical or AI-driven processes, such as graph-based code analysis, dependency mapping, or LLM (Large Language Model) operations within SAP. It reduces redundant computation and accelerates repeated queries or calculations.

### 3.2 Process Integration

- Used by LLM modules and graph analysis tools to cache results between steps or sessions.
- Supports scenarios where repeated access to computed data is required (e.g., tokenization, embeddings, dependency graphs).

### 3.3 Operational Impact

- Improves performance and scalability of analytical processes.
- Reduces database and compute load by avoiding redundant calculations.
- Enables session or context-specific caching via the seed mechanism.

## 4. Support & Maintenance

### 4.1 Configuration

- **Seed Management**: The default seed can be set via `_SET_DEFAULT_SEED`.
- **Codec Selection**: Optional codec can be provided for value encoding/decoding.
- **Table Maintenance**: Periodic trimming (`trim`) is recommended to prevent table growth.

### 4.2 Monitoring

- Monitor the size and growth of `ZLLM_00_CACHE`.
- Check for long-lived or stale entries (older than 14 days).
- Ensure database performance is not impacted by excessive cache volume.

### 4.3 Common Issues

- **Stale Data**: If `trim` is not called regularly, old cache entries may accumulate.
- **Seed Confusion**: Using incorrect seeds may lead to cache misses or data leakage between contexts.
- **Codec Mismatch**: If the wrong codec is used, data may not be decoded correctly.
- **Authorization**: Ensure only authorized users/programs can access or clear the cache.

## CLAS.ZCL_LLM_00_CODEC.DOCUMENT.MD

# ABAP Component Documentation: ZCL_LLM_00_CODEC

## 1. Component Overview

- **Type**: ABAP Class (`ZCL_LLM_00_CODEC`)
- **Technical Category**: Utility / Technical Service â€“ Data Encoding/Decoding
- **System Role**: Provides a simple, deterministic encoding/decoding mechanism (XOR-based) for binary data (XSTRING), used as a codec utility within the $ZLLM_00 lightweight LLM module.

## 2. Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Core Functionality

`ZCL_LLM_00_CODEC` implements a simple symmetric codec for XSTRING data using XOR operations. Its main purpose is to encode and decode binary data in a reversible way, primarily for obfuscation, lightweight protection, or as a technical requirement for storing/transmitting data in the LLM module.

- **Encoding/Decoding**: Both operations are identical (XOR is its own inverse), so the same logic is used for both.
- **Seeded Randomness**: The codec uses a seed derived from the first two bytes of the XSTRING key to initialize a random number generator, which is then used to generate a pseudo-random byte stream for the XOR operation.
- **Symmetry**: The `encode` and `decode` methods are functionally equivalent; decoding is implemented by calling `encode` again.

### 2.2 Technical Architecture

- **Interfaces**:
  - Implements `ZIF_LLM_00_CODEC`, which defines at least `encode` and `decode` methods for XSTRING data.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Uses `cl_abap_random` for pseudo-random number generation.
  - Relies on utility methods from `zcl_llm` (e.g., `xstring_hash`, `string_hash`) for key derivation.
  - Reads from SAP parameter ID `ZLLM_CODEC` if no key is provided.
- **Data Flow**:
  - The codec is instantiated with a key (XSTRING).
  - The key is used to seed the random number generator.
  - For each byte in the input, a random byte and a byte from the key (in circular fashion) are XORed with the input byte to produce the output.

### 2.3 Implementation Details

#### Key Methods

- **CONSTRUCTOR**
  - Stores the key (`mv_`) and derives a seed (`mv_seed`) from the first two bytes of the key.
- **NEW (Static Factory)**
  - If a key is provided, hashes it to produce a deterministic XSTRING key.
  - If not, retrieves a value from SAP parameter ID `ZLLM_CODEC`, hashes it, and uses that as the key.
  - Returns a new instance of the codec.
- **encode / decode**
  - For each byte in the input:
    - XORs the input byte with a random byte (from seeded RNG) and a byte from the key (circularly).
    - Appends the result to the output.
  - Since XOR is symmetric, encoding and decoding are the same operation.

#### Example Pseudocode

```
for each byte in input:
    random_byte = next_random()
    key_byte = key[ position mod key_length ]
    output_byte = input_byte XOR random_byte XOR key_byte
    append output_byte to output
```

#### Security/Obfuscation

- This is **not cryptographically secure**; it is suitable only for obfuscation or lightweight reversible encoding, not for strong encryption.

#### Error Handling

- No explicit error handling; relies on ABAP runtime for exceptions (e.g., invalid XSTRING operations).
- If no key is provided and parameter ID is missing, may result in a weak or default key.

#### Performance

- Efficient for small to moderate XSTRINGs.
- For very large data, performance is linear in input size.

## 3. Business Context

### 3.1 Business Purpose

- **Primary Use**: Obfuscation or lightweight encoding of binary data within the $ZLLM_00 LLM module.
- **Typical Scenarios**:
  - Storing or transmitting binary artifacts (e.g., model files, cache blobs) in a way that is not trivially readable.
  - Ensuring that temporary or cached data is not stored in plain form.

### 3.2 Process Integration

- Used by other components in the $ZLLM_00 package, especially those dealing with binary data storage or transmission (see related classes such as `ZCL_LLM_00_CACHE`, `ZCL_LLM_00_FILE_LIST_BIN`).
- May be invoked automatically as part of caching, file handling, or data serialization/deserialization.

### 3.3 Operational Impact

- **Data Integrity**: As long as the same key is used, data can be reliably encoded and decoded.
- **Security**: Provides only minimal protection; not suitable for sensitive or regulated data.

## 4. Support & Maintenance

### 4.1 Configuration

- **Parameter ID**: If no key is provided, the codec uses the value from SAP parameter ID `ZLLM_CODEC`. This should be set appropriately for consistent operation.
- **Key Management**: Consistent key usage is required for successful decoding.

### 4.2 Monitoring

- No direct monitoring hooks; issues would surface as data corruption or inability to decode data.
- Ensure that the key/parameter ID is not changed unexpectedly.

### 4.3 Common Issues

- **Key Mismatch**: Using a different key for decoding than encoding will result in unreadable data.
- **Parameter ID Missing**: If the parameter is not set and no key is provided, the codec may use a default or empty key, reducing obfuscation.
- **Large Data**: For very large XSTRINGs, performance may be a concern.

## CLAS.ZCL_LLM_00_FILE_BIN.DOCUMENT.MD

# ABAP Component Documentation: ZCL_LLM_00_FILE_BIN

## 1. Component Overview

- **Type**: ABAP Class (`ZCL_LLM_00_FILE_BIN`)
- **Technical Category**: File abstraction, binary file access, database interaction
- **System Role**: Provides an object-oriented interface for accessing and decoding binary file data (blobs) stored in the temporary table `ZLLM_00_BIN` within the $ZLLM_00 package. Used as part of a lightweight LLM (Large Language Model) module for SAP, supporting file-based operations on binary artifacts.

## 2. Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Core Functionality

`ZCL_LLM_00_FILE_BIN` is a specialized subclass of `ZCL_LLM_00_FILE` designed to represent and interact with binary files (blobs) stored in the database table `ZLLM_00_BIN`. Its main responsibilities are:

- Loading binary file metadata and content from the database using a unique key (`bin`, `name`).
- Providing a method to retrieve the binary content as an XSTRING, optionally decoding it using a pluggable codec interface (`ZIF_LLM_00_CODEC`).
- Supporting instantiation via a static factory method (`NEW`) with optional codec injection.

### 2.2 Technical Architecture

- **Interfaces**:
  - Implements `ZIF_LLM_00_FILE` (specifically, the `GET_XSTRING` method).
  - Uses `ZIF_LLM_00_CODEC` for optional decoding of binary content.

- **Dependencies**:
  - **Database Table**: `ZLLM_00_BIN` (stores binary blobs and metadata).
  - **Superclass**: `ZCL_LLM_00_FILE` (provides generic file abstraction).
  - **Codec**: `ZIF_LLM_00_CODEC` (for encoding/decoding binary data).
  - **Related Classes**: `ZCL_LLM_00_CODEC`, `ZCL_LLM_00_CODEC_MOCK` (default/mock codecs).

- **Data Flow**:
  1. **Construction**: Loads metadata from `ZLLM_00_BIN` using provided keys.
  2. **Binary Retrieval**: On `GET_XSTRING`, fetches the binary content from the table and decodes it if a codec is present.

### 2.3 Implementation Details

- **Constructor**:
  - Accepts `IV_BIN` (binary key), `IV_NAME` (file name), and `IO_CODEC` (codec instance).
  - Loads the corresponding record from `ZLLM_00_BIN` into the private structure `ms_`.
  - Sets the file path and name for the instance.

- **Static Factory Method (`NEW`)**:
  - Allows creation of a new instance with optional codec injection.
  - If no codec is provided, defaults to `ZCL_LLM_00_CODEC=>NEW()` (can be switched to a mock for testing).

- **GET_XSTRING Method**:
  - Retrieves the binary content (`v` field) from `ZLLM_00_BIN` for the current file.
  - If a codec is present, decodes the content before returning.
  - Returns immediately if the record is not found.

- **Private Members**:
  - `ms_`: Structure holding the current file's metadata and keys.
  - `mo_codec`: Reference to the codec used for decoding.

- **Error Handling**:
  - If the binary content is not found (`sy-subrc ne 0`), the method returns an empty result.
  - No explicit logging; relies on calling context for error propagation.

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Uses `SELECT SINGLE` for efficient, indexed access.
  - Minimal memory footprint; only loads one record at a time.

- **Security Implications**:
  - No explicit authorization checks; assumes upstream validation.
  - Decoding is handled via injected codec, which could be a security boundary (ensure trusted codecs).

## 3. Business Context

### 3.2 Process Integration

- Used by higher-level components that need to read or process binary files as part of LLM operations (e.g., loading model checkpoints, embeddings, or configuration files).
- Supports caching and extensibility by allowing different codecs for encoding/decoding.

### 3.3 Operational Impact

- Enables efficient, object-oriented access to binary data in the SAP system.
- Supports modular AI/LLM workflows by abstracting file storage and retrieval.
- Decouples file format/encoding from business logic via codec injection.

## 4. Support & Maintenance

### 4.1 Configuration

- **Codec Injection**: Can be configured to use different codecs for decoding binary data.

## CLAS.ZCL_LLM_00_FILE_LOCAL.DOCUMENT.MD

# ABAP Component Documentation: ZCL_LLM_00_FILE_LOCAL

## 1. Component Overview

- **Type**: ABAP Class (`ZCL_LLM_00_FILE_LOCAL`)
- **Technical Category**: File Handling / Local File Abstraction
- **System Role**: Implements the interface for reading local files as binary data, providing a bridge between the SAP ABAP environment and the local file system (typically on the SAP GUI frontend). Part of the `$ZLLM_00` package, which supports lightweight LLM (Large Language Model) and code intelligence tooling.

## 2. Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Core Functionality

`ZCL_LLM_00_FILE_LOCAL` is a concrete implementation of the abstract file class `ZCL_LLM_00_FILE`. Its primary purpose is to represent and provide access to files located on the local frontend (user's PC) from within the SAP GUI environment. It enables reading the contents of a local file as an XSTRING (binary string), which is essential for further processing, such as uploading, parsing, or passing to other components (e.g., LLM models, caching, or binary storage).

Key operations:
- **Construction**: Accepts a file path and extracts the file name.
- **Reading**: Implements the `GET_XSTRING` method to read the file's binary content using SAP GUI frontend services.

### 2.2 Technical Architecture

- **Interfaces**:
  - Implements `ZIF_LLM_00_FILE` (file abstraction interface).
- **Inheritance**:
  - Inherits from `ZCL_LLM_00_FILE` (base class for file operations).
- **Key Methods**:
  - `CONSTRUCTOR`: Initializes the object with a file path, extracts the file name.
  - `NEW`: Static constructor for instantiation.
  - `ZIF_LLM_00_FILE~GET_XSTRING`: Reads the file as binary and returns as XSTRING.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `CL_GUI_FRONTEND_SERVICES`: Used for file upload (reading local files).
  - Function module `SCMS_BINARY_TO_XSTRING`: Converts binary table to XSTRING.
- **Data Flow**:
  1. File path is provided at instantiation.
  2. When `GET_XSTRING` is called, the file is read from the local system into a RAW table.
  3. The RAW table is converted to XSTRING and returned.

### 2.3 Implementation Details

#### Constructor Logic

- Accepts a file path (`iv_`).
- Determines the file name by searching for the last `/` or `\` in the path.
- Sets `mv_name` to the extracted file name or the full path if no delimiter is found.

#### File Reading Logic

- Uses `CL_GUI_FRONTEND_SERVICES=>GUI_UPLOAD` to read the file as binary (`filetype = 'BIN'`).
- Handles various exceptions (file not found, permission issues, etc.).
- On success, uses `SCMS_BINARY_TO_XSTRING` to convert the binary data to XSTRING.
- Returns the XSTRING; if an error occurs, returns nothing.

#### Example Usage

```abap
DATA(lo_file) = zcl_llm_00_file_local=>new( 'C:\temp\myfile.bin' ).
DATA(lv_xstring) = lo_file->zif_llm_00_file~get_xstring( ).
```

It is central to the orchestration of LLM workflows in the ZLLM_00 module.

---

## 2. Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Core Functionality

`ZCL_LLM_00_FLOW_LAZY` provides a flexible mechanism to define and execute a sequence (flow) of LLM processing steps. Its main responsibilities include:

- **Flow Construction**: Instantiates a flow from a list of patterns (`PAT`), formulas, or directly from step objects.
- **Step Orchestration**: Manages the execution order, input/output passing, and result collection for each step in the flow.
- **Debugging Support**: Offers hooks for tracing and debugging the flow execution.
- **Interface Implementation**: Implements `zif_llm_00_flow_lazy` and delegates step execution to `zif_llm_00_step_lazy`.

#### Key Operations

- **new_from_pat_list / new_from_formula_list / new**: Factory methods to construct a flow from various sources (pattern list, formula list, or explicit step list).
- **exec / go**: Executes the flow, delegating to the step execution logic.
- **next**: Advances to the next step in the flow, passing along intermediate results.
- **collect**: Aggregates results from the executed steps.
- **start**: Initiates the flow, chaining step execution.
- **Debugging**: `_debug`, `_in`, `_out` methods for tracing input/output during execution.

### 2.2 Technical Architecture

#### Interfaces

- **Implements**: `zif_llm_00_flow_lazy` (main flow interface)
- **Delegates**: `zif_llm_00_step_lazy` (step execution interface)

#### Dependencies

- **Step Classes**: `zcl_llm_00_step_lazy` (for step instantiation and execution)
- **Pattern/Formulas**: `zif_llm_00_pat_list`, `zif_llm_00_formula_list`
- **LLM Engine**: `zif_llm_00_llm_lazy`
- **Tracing**: `zif_llm_00_trace`
- **JSON Utility**: `zcl_llm_00_json` (for debug output)

#### Data Flow

- **Input**: Receives input data (`mr_in`) and step result objects.
- **Processing**: Sequentially executes each step, passing results as input to the next.
- **Output**: Final result is available in `mr_out` or via `collect`.
- **Debugging**: Optionally logs input/output at each step if debugging is enabled.

#### Class Data

- **gv_debug**: Global debug flag (class-level)
- **go_trace**: Global trace object (class-level)

#### Instance Data

- **mo_pat_list / mo_form_list**: Pattern/formula lists
- **mo_llm**: LLM engine instance
- **mt_pat / mt_form / mt_step**: Step lists

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Steps are executed in sequence, each passing its output to the next.
- **Strategy/Delegation**: Step execution is delegated to `zcl_llm_00_step_lazy` instances.

#### Algorithm Explanation

- **Flow Construction**: Depending on the input (pattern list, formula list, or explicit steps), the constructor builds the internal step list (`mt_step`) by instantiating step objects for each pattern/formula.
- **Step Execution**: The `start` method loops through all steps, passing the result of each as input to the next. The `next` method advances the flow by one step.
- **Result Collection**: The `collect` method aggregates the results, caching them for repeated access.
- **Debugging**: If debugging is enabled, input and output at each step are serialized to JSON and sent to the trace object.

#### Error Handling and Logging

- **Minimal explicit error handling**: Relies on ABAP runtime exceptions for most error scenarios.
- **Debugging/Tracing**: Controlled via `gv_debug` and `go_trace`. If enabled, logs JSON representations of input/output.

#### Performance Considerations

- **In-memory processing**: All flow and step data are managed in memory; no direct database operations.
- **Debugging overhead**: Enabling debugging may impact performance due to JSON serialization and trace calls.

#### Security Implications

- **No direct security checks**: Assumes caller has appropriate authorization.
- **Sensitive data**: If input/output contains sensitive data, ensure trace/debug output is secured.

## CLAS.ZCL_LLM_00_LLM_LAZY_BALANCER.DOCUMENT.MD

# ABAP Component Documentation: ZCL_LLM_00_LLM_LAZY_BALANCER

## 1. Component Overview

- **Type**: ABAP Class (`ZCL_LLM_00_LLM_LAZY_BALANCER`)
- **Technical Category**: AI/LLM Orchestration, Load Balancing, Predictive Token Management
- **System Role**: 
  - Part of the `$ZLLM_00` package, which implements a lightweight LLM (Large Language Model) module for SAP.
  - This class acts as a load balancer and orchestrator for multiple LLM instances, optimizing their usage based on token limits and model capabilities.

## 2. Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Core Functionality

`ZCL_LLM_00_LLM_LAZY_BALANCER` is responsible for:
- Managing a group of LLM (Large Language Model) instances, each potentially with different token limits and model types.
- Distributing incoming LLM requests to the most appropriate LLM instance based on the predicted token usage of the request and the capabilities of each model.
- Maintaining a pool of `predictoken` objects, which are used to estimate the number of tokens a request will consume for each model type.
- Handling HTTP responses from LLM endpoints, including error handling and message propagation.
- Providing a factory method for instantiation and implementing the `ZIF_LLM_00_LLM_LAZY` interface for seamless integration with the rest of the LLM framework.

### 2.2 Technical Architecture

- **Interfaces**:
  - `ZIF_LLM_00_TYPES`: Provides type definitions for LLM operations.
  - `ZIF_LLM_00_LLM_LAZY`: Defines the contract for lazy LLM invocation, including methods for querying, configuration, and payload adaptation.

- **Dependencies**:
  - `ZCL_LLM_00_PREDICTOKEN`: Used for predicting token usage for each model type.
  - `ZCL_LLM_00_PAYLOAD_ADAPTER`: Used to adapt payloads for LLM requests.
  - `ZCL_LLM_00_JSON_MOCK`: Used for JSON manipulation and request adaptation.
  - `ZIF_LLM_00_LLM_LAZY`: Interface for LLM instances.
  - `ZCX_S`: Custom exception class for error handling.
  - SAP HTTP client interfaces (`IF_HTTP_CLIENT`).

- **Data Flow**:
  - On instantiation, the class receives a list of LLM instances and groups them by their maximum token capacity.
  - For each incoming request, the class:
    1. Predicts the token usage using the appropriate `predictoken` instance.
    2. Selects the LLM group whose token limit can accommodate the request.
    3. Rotates through the group to balance load.
    4. Adapts the request JSON to target the selected model.
    5. Forwards the request and returns the response.

### 2.3 Implementation Details

- **Grouping Logic**: LLMs are grouped by their `max_token` property. Each group maintains a round-robin pointer (`current`) to distribute requests evenly.
- **Token Prediction**: For each model type, a `predictoken` instance is created and cached. This is used to estimate the number of tokens a request will consume, ensuring requests are routed to models that can handle them.
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: The `q` method dynamically selects the best-fit LLM based on predicted token usage and updates the request payload to target the selected model.
- **Error Handling**: HTTP errors are captured and raised as custom exceptions (`ZCX_S`), with detailed error messages stored in a class variable (`GV_MSG`).
- **Factory Pattern**: The `NEW` class-method provides a standardized way to instantiate the balancer with a given set of LLMs.
- **Interface Implementation**: Implements all required methods of `ZIF_LLM_00_LLM_LAZY`, ensuring compatibility with the broader LLM framework.

#### Key Methods

- `CONSTRUCTOR`: Initializes LLM groups, sets up token predictors, and determines primary/backup LLMs.
- `ADD_PDT_FOR_LLM`: Ensures a `predictoken` instance exists for each model type.
- `GET_NEXT_LLM_IN_GROUP`: Implements round-robin selection within a group.
- `Q`: Main entry point for LLM requests; predicts tokens, selects LLM, adapts payload, and delegates the request.
- `API_RECEIVE` / `RAISE_LAST_ERROR`: Handles HTTP response and error propagation.

# ABAP Component Documentation: ZCL_LLM_00_LLM_LAZY_COMPOSITE

## 1. Component Overview

- **Type**: ABAP Class (`ZCL_LLM_00_LLM_LAZY_COMPOSITE`)
- **Technical Category**: Business Logic / AI Integration / Composite Pattern
- **System Role**: Composite LLM (Large Language Model) selector and dispatcher; mediates between lightweight and "expensive" LLM implementations based on input complexity.

**Namespace/Location**:  
- Custom namespace (`ZCL_`), part of the `$ZLLM_00` package (see [Related Components](#5-additional-information)).

**Component Role in System Architecture**:  
- This class acts as a composite/facade for two LLM implementations: a lightweight (fast, cheap) and an expensive (more capable, resource-intensive) model. It dynamically selects which LLM to use for a given request, based on a token threshold, optimizing for cost and performance.

---

## 2. Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Core Functionality

**Purpose**:  
- To provide a single interface (`zif_llm_00_llm_lazy`) for LLM operations, but internally route requests to either a lightweight or an expensive LLM implementation, depending on the predicted complexity (token count) of the input.

**How it works**:
- On instantiation, the class is provided with:
  - A lightweight LLM instance (`io_llm`)
  - An expensive LLM instance (`io_llm_exp`)
  - A token threshold (`iv_threshold`)
  - Optionally, a cache instance (`io_cache`)
- When a query (`q`) is made:
  - The input is serialized to JSON.
  - The number of tokens is predicted using the lightweight LLM's tokenizer.
  - If the token count is below or equal to the threshold, the lightweight LLM is used (with the model name forcibly set to the lightweight model in the JSON).
  - If above the threshold, the expensive LLM is used.

**Key Methods**:
- `new`: Factory method to instantiate the composite.
- `constructor`: Initializes internal references and token predictors.
- `zif_llm_00_llm_lazy~q`: Main query method, performs dynamic routing.
- `zif_llm_00_llm_lazy~get_config`: Returns the configuration of the expensive LLM (for compatibility).
- `zif_llm_00_llm_lazy~get_payload_adapter`: Returns a payload adapter for this composite.

### 2.2 Technical Architecture

- **Interfaces**:
  - `zif_llm_00_types`: Likely provides type definitions.
  - `zif_llm_00_llm_lazy`: Main interface for LLM operations (query, config, etc.).

- **Dependencies**:
  - `zif_llm_00_llm_lazy`: Both lightweight and expensive LLMs must implement this interface.
  - `zcl_llm_00_predictoken`: Used to predict token count for input.
  - `zcl_llm_00_payload_adapter`: For adapting payloads to LLM APIs.
  - `zcl_llm_00_json_mock`: Used to manipulate JSON input for lightweight LLM.
  - `zif_llm_00_cache`: Optional caching layer.

- **Data Flow**:
  1. Input arrives via `q` method.
  2. Input is serialized to JSON.
  3. Token count is predicted.
  4. If below threshold:
     - Model name in JSON is set to lightweight model.
     - JSON is wrapped in a mock object.
     - Query is routed to lightweight LLM.
  5. If above threshold:
     - Query is routed to expensive LLM.
  6. Result is returned.

### 2.3 Implementation Details

- **Design Pattern**: Composite/Facade with dynamic dispatch based on input complexity.
- **Algorithm**:
  - Uses a tokenizer to estimate the cost/complexity of the request.
  - Performs string replacement in JSON to ensure correct model selection.
- **Error Handling**: Not explicitly shown in this class; relies on underlying LLM implementations for error management.
- **Performance**: Optimizes for cost and speed by avoiding expensive LLM calls for simple/short requests.
- **Security**: No direct security logic; assumes underlying LLMs and adapters handle sensitive data appropriately.

- **Instance Method `NEXT`**: Returns the next slice (chunk) of the table, updating the progress.

#### Data Structures

- **`ts_slice`**: Structure holding slice metadata (`index`, `start`, `end`).
- **`tt_slice`**: Table of `ts_slice`, representing all calculated slices.
- **`mr_`**: Generic reference to the original input table.
- **`mt_`**: Table holding all slice definitions.
- **`ms_`**: Current slice metadata.
- **`mv_index`**: Current slice index (progress tracker).

#### Dependencies

- No external dependencies; operates on generic internal tables.
- No direct database or RFC/API calls.
- Related to other LLM (Lightweight LLM) utility classes in the `$ZLLM_00` package.

#### Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: Table and slice size are provided; slice boundaries are calculated and stored.
2. **Iteration**: Each call to `NEXT` returns the next slice of the table, until all slices are processed.

### 2.3 Implementation Details

- **Slice Calculation**: In the constructor, the class calculates how many full slices fit into the table (`mv_times`) and if there is a remainder (`mv_last_slice`). Each slice is defined by its start and end row numbers.
- **Edge Case Handling**: If the last slice is smaller than the standard slice size, it is handled separately to ensure all rows are included.
- **Generic Table Handling**: Uses field-symbols and generic data references to support any table type.
- **Stateful Iteration**: Maintains internal state (`mv_index`) to allow repeated calls to `NEXT` to return successive slices.
- **Performance**: Designed for efficiencyâ€”no copying of the entire table, only the relevant slice is appended to the output on each call.

**Example Usage:**
```abap
DATA(lo_slicer) = zcl_llm_00_slice=>new( it_ = my_table iv_slice = 500 ).
DATA: lt_slice TYPE INDEX TABLE.
WHILE lo_slicer->next( CHANGING ct_ = lt_slice ) = abap_true.
  " Process lt_slice here
ENDWHILE.
```

## 3. Business Context

### 3.1 Business Purpose

This class is a technical utility, not directly tied to a business process, but it enables efficient handling of large datasets in business applications. It is especially relevant in scenarios where:
- Large tables must be processed in manageable chunks (e.g., for batch jobs, parallelization, or UI progress feedback).
- Resource constraints or system limits require chunked processing.
- Progress tracking or reporting is needed for long-running operations.

### 3.2 Process Integration

- Used as a backend helper in analytical, batch, or AI/LLM-driven processes where large tables are common.
- Can be integrated into any ABAP process that needs to iterate over large datasets in slices.
- Supports the broader `$ZLLM_00` package, which is focused on lightweight LLM and graph-based code analysis.

### 3.3 Operational Impact

- Improves robustness and scalability of processes dealing with large tables.
- Reduces risk of memory overflows or timeouts by enabling chunked processing.
- Facilitates progress reporting and parallel execution strategies.

## 4. Support & Maintenance

### 4.1 Configuration

- No external configuration required.
- Slice size (`iv_slice`) can be adjusted per use case.

### 4.2 Monitoring

- No built-in logging or monitoring.
- Progress can be tracked externally by monitoring the number of slices processed.

### 4.3 Common Issues

- **Incorrect slice size**: Setting `iv_slice` to zero or negative defaults to 1000.
- **Table type mismatch**: Input table must be an INDEX TABLE; otherwise, runtime errors may occur.
- **Stateful usage**: Each instance tracks its own progress; do not share instances across unrelated processes.

---

## Security Considerations

- No direct security implications; operates on internal tables in memory.
- Ensure input data is validated in calling context if sensitive.

---

## Example Scenario

**Scenario**: You have a table with 10,000 records to process, but want to handle only 1,000 at a time to avoid memory issues.

**Solution**: Use `ZCL_LLM_00_SLICE` to iterate through the table in 10 slices of 1,000 records each, processing each slice in turn.

---

## Design Pattern

- **Iterator Pattern**: The class encapsulates iteration logic, allowing the caller to process one slice at a time without managing indices manually.

---

## Maintenance Notes

- The class is final and create private, so instantiation is only via the `NEW` class method.
- No persistent state; all data is in-memory and instance-specific.
- No external dependencies, making it stable and low-maintenance.

---

**In summary:**  
`ZCL_LLM_00_SLICE` is a robust, reusable utility for dividing large internal tables into manageable slices, supporting scalable and efficient ABAP processing in analytical and technical scenarios. It is a foundational building block for batch, parallel, or progress-aware operations in the broader LLM and code analysis framework.

## CLAS.ZCL_LLM_00_STEP_LP_SPLIT.DOCUMENT.MD

# ABAP Component Documentation: ZCL_LLM_00_STEP_LP_SPLIT

## 1. Component Overview

- **Type**: ABAP Class (`ZCL_LLM_00_STEP_LP_SPLIT`)
- **Technical Category**: Processing Step / Utility (String/Table Splitter)
- **System Role**: Internal processing step within the $ZLLM_00 Lightweight LLM Module, used for splitting strings or tables of strings as part of a larger LLM (Large Language Model) orchestration or workflow.

## 2. Technical Analysis

### 2.1 Core Functionality

`ZCL_LLM_00_STEP_LP_SPLIT` is a utility class designed to act as a "step" in a lazy-evaluated processing pipeline for LLM-related operations. Its primary purpose is to split a string or a table of strings, likely as part of a data preparation or transformation phase in LLM workflows.

- **Implements Interface**: `ZIF_LLM_00_STEP_LAZY`
  - This interface defines the contract for a "lazy step" in the LLM pipeline, with methods for execution (`EXEC`), starting the step (`START`), and collecting results (`COLLECT`).
- **Aliases**: For convenience, the class defines aliases for the interface methods:
  - `EXEC` â†’ `ZIF_LLM_00_STEP_LAZY~EXEC`
  - `START` â†’ `ZIF_LLM_00_STEP_LAZY~START`
  - `YIELD` â†’ `ZIF_LLM_00_STEP_LAZY~COLLECT`

**Key Operations:**
- **Splitting**: The class is responsible for splitting input data (string or table of strings) into smaller parts, which is a common preprocessing step for LLMs (e.g., chunking text for tokenization or parallel processing).
- **Step Result Handling**: It delegates the actual split logic to a result class (`ZCL_LLM_00_STEP_LP_SPLIT_RES`), which encapsulates the output of the split operation.

### 2.2 Technical Architecture

- **Interfaces**:
  - `ZIF_LLM_00_STEP_LAZY`: Defines the step contract for lazy evaluation in the LLM pipeline.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `ZIF_LLM_00_LLM_LAZY`: Reference to the LLM engine/context.
  - `ZCL_LLM_00_STEP_LP_SPLIT_RES`: Result class for the split operation.
  - `ZIF_LLM_00_STEP_RESULT`, `ZIF_LLM_00_STRING`: Used for handling results and string operations.
- **Data Flow**:
  - The class receives input (string/table) and an LLM context.
  - On execution, it creates a result object (`ZCL_LLM_00_STEP_LP_SPLIT_RES`) that performs the actual split.
  - Results are collected and returned via the interface methods.

#### Method Overview

- **NEW**: Factory method to instantiate the class with a given LLM context.
- **constructor**: Stores the LLM context for use in processing.
- **zif_llm_00_step_lazy~start**: Instantiates the result class, passing along input and context.
- **zif_llm_00_step_lazy~exec**: Calls `start`, then collects the result.
- **zif_llm_00_step_lazy~collect**: Delegates to the result's collect method.

### 2.3 Implementation Details

- **Design Pattern**: Factory method (`NEW`) and interface-based polymorphism (`ZIF_LLM_00_STEP_LAZY`).
- **Delegation**: The actual split logic is not implemented in this class but is delegated to `ZCL_LLM_00_STEP_LP_SPLIT_RES`, promoting separation of concerns.
- **State Management**: Maintains references to input, result, and LLM context.
- **No direct database or external system interaction**: Purely in-memory processing step.

## 3. Business Context

### 3.1 Business Purpose

This class supports the business need for flexible, modular, and scalable processing of text data within SAP's LLM integration framework. By enabling the splitting of strings or tables, it allows for:

- Preprocessing steps required for LLM-based analytics, code intelligence, or automation scenarios.

### 3.2 Process Integration

- **Workflow Role**: Used as a step in LLM-driven workflows, such as document analysis, code parsing, or conversational AI pipelines.
- **Integration**: Works in conjunction with other step classes, result handlers, and the LLM context to form a complete processing pipeline.

### 3.3 Operational Impact

- **Performance**: Enables parallelization and chunking, which can improve throughput and resource utilization in LLM scenarios.
- **Maintainability**: Modular design allows for easy extension or replacement of the split logic without impacting the overall workflow.

## 4. Support & Maintenance
